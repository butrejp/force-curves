# force-curves
force curves for various switches, both factory and frankenstein.  I can test with or without keycaps, and I can test non-mx switches so long as they're discrete, and find actuation points so long as the sensing mechanism is contact based.

testing aparatus is a cheap load cell and a 0.5mm pitch screw in a 3d printed fixture.  actuation point is found by an LED hooked up to a gateron hot swap socket inside the fixture.  ± 0.25mm positional accuracy, ±3g force accuracy.
